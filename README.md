# Barca Players

This project showcases the players of the Barcelona football team. 

## Tech Stack

The project is developed with the following stack:

- **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)**: A modern UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces using a declarative approach, making the UI more dynamic and intuitive.
- **[MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)**: A proven architectural pattern that separates UI and business logic, improving code organization and making the app easier to test and maintain.
- **[Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)**: A dependency injection framework that simplifies the process of providing and managing dependencies across the app, improving scalability and reducing boilerplate code.
- **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)**: A powerful Kotlin feature for writing asynchronous code in a simple and readable way, used here for tasks like making network requests and database operations.
- **[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)**: A reactive programming tool for managing and emitting streams of data, perfect for handling dynamic state changes and data synchronization within the app.
- **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)**: A type-safe HTTP client that simplifies making API requests, parsing responses, and handling errors effectively.
- **[Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)**: A database library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, ensuring better handling of offline data and simplifying database operations.
- **[Coil (Coil-Compose)](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/)**: A lightweight image-loading library optimized for Android, used to load and display player images efficiently in the app.

## Testing

To ensure a reliable and high-quality app, the project uses the following testing tools:

- **[JUnit](https://junit.org/)**: A popular framework for writing and running tests, ensuring the correctness of business logic and app behavior.
- **[MockK](https://mockk.io/)**: A Kotlin-first mocking library that helps create mock objects for testing, enabling simulation of different scenarios without relying on external dependencies.
